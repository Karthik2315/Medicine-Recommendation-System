# 💊 Medicine-Recommendation-System

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the disease based on user-provided symptoms and provides a full health guidance package. The system not only recommends possible diseases but also includes:

- ✅ Disease name and description
- 🥗 Diet suggestions
- 🏃‍♂️ Recommended workouts
- ⚠️ Precautions

## 📁 Project Structure

- datasets/ # Contains datasets used for training/testing the ML model
-  models/ # Stores trained machine learning models
-   static/ # Contains static assets like PNG logos
-   templates/ # HTML templates for the frontend UI
-   Main.ipynb # Jupyter notebook used for model development and testing
-   Main.py # Main backend script to run the web application
-  README.md # Project documentation

## 🚀 Features

- Trained ML model for medicine recommendation
- Web interface for user input and results
- Developed and tested in Jupyter before deployment
- Modular structure (datasets, models, frontend/backend separation)
